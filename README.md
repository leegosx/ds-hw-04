# Linear Regression: Overfitting and Regularization

This project focuses on the analysis of overfitting in linear models and regularization methods in the context of predicting the number of bike rentals.

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing the `bikes_rent.csv` dataset, which contains information about dates, weather conditions, and the number of bike rentals. The primary goal is to build a linear regression model that effectively predicts the number of rentals and to study the impact of various factors on this metric.

## Key Details

- Data Handling: Loading, cleaning, and analyzing the data structure.
- Linear Regression: Developing and training a model for prediction.
- Regularization: Applying Lasso and Ridge regression to control overfitting.
- Results Analysis: Evaluating the effectiveness of models and interpreting the coefficients obtained.

## Technologies

The project is implemented using Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.

## Usage

To review the analysis and results, open the `OverfittingHomeWork.ipynb` file in the Jupyter Notebook environment.
